# Handy Unix Tools

Various useful utils around the system. Most were developed by me, unless stated otherwise.

- [feeder](./feeder) - feed one argument at a time to a program that accepts only a single argument
- [makegdocs](./makegdocs) - convert a folder of scanned images into a sequence of pdfs, under 11MB each - so that these can be uploaded to google drive and subsequently auto-OCRed by google docs.
- [makepdf](./makepdf) - convert a folder of scanned images into a pdf file
- [rename.pl](./rename.pl) - rename dir/file names using perl regex as an argument - a very old but still extremely useful program written by Larry Wall in 1990! You definitely want to have this one in your `$PATH` directory.
- [cmd-reformat.md](./cmd-reformat.md) - a one liner tool to compared 2 sets of cmd args and also to format/sort cmd args - same as a program: [cmd-reformat](./cmd-reformat).
